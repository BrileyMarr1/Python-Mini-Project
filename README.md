This is a very simple program and is supposed to simulate a sort of D&D fight encounter. 
In the code I chose to make the monster a Goblin in all of the dialog just to make it simple. 
The code uses a lot of If-Else statements to go through all of the possible fighting Scenarios. I did not include any sort of movement phases or anything like that, this just rolls for initiative, and then rolls for attack hits. 
I have included a "Stats" function that rolls for stats like a typical D&D character creation, but for now they don't mean anything. I put them there to possibly be used at a later time. And also for looks and immersion. 
I will also say, I did not include a critical hit functionality for a Nat 20 roll. So all rolls are as is.
